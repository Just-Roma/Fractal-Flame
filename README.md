This is an implementation of the Fractal Flame algorithm as described in its original publication by Scott Draves:
https://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf

[START SCRIPT](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Just-Roma/Fractal-Flame/main/FractalFlame.html)

Since the creation process is computationally very slow, the main calculations are conducted in the background thread. An image is being created stepwise and becomes more well-defined and attractive in each new step.
